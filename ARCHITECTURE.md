# Architecture

aing is a harness engineering agent framework for Claude Code. This document explains the design decisions and module structure.

## Core Idea

15 named agents collaborate through a PDCA cycle (Plan→Do→Check→Act→Review), with complexity-based model routing, evidence-based verification, and self-healing recovery.

```
User Input
  ↓
Intent Router (11 routes, bilingual)
  ↓
Complexity Scorer (0-15 points)
  ↓
Team Preset (Solo/Duo/Squad/Full)
  ↓
Agent Spawning (parallel, model-routed)
  ↓
PDCA Cycle (5 stages, enforced)
  ↓
Evidence Chain (test/build/lint/review)
  ↓
Sam Verdict (ACHIEVED / INCOMPLETE / FAILED)
```

## Module Structure

## Multi-AI Consensus (`scripts/multi-ai/`)

Three independent AI voices (Claude, Codex, Gemini) vote on non-trivial decisions through a structured consensus protocol.

- **cli-bridge.ts** — `createBridge(provider)` factory returns a uniform `.ask()` / `.review()` / `.challenge()` interface per AI backend. **Active**: used by session-start and user-prompt-submit hooks for Codex tier detection.
- **consensus-engine.ts** — Collects votes, classifies decisions (`MECHANICAL`/`TASTE`/`USER_CHALLENGE`/`SECURITY_WARNING`), applies quorum rules. **[NOT INTEGRATED]**: implemented and tested but not imported by any production code path. Available for future PDCA review-stage integration when complexityScore >= 10.

See `docs/MULTI-AI.md` for the full architecture document.

## MCP Browse QA (`scripts/review/`)

Browser-based QA testing using Playwright MCP, integrated into the evidence chain.

- **browser-evidence.mjs** — Drives headless Playwright via MCP to navigate pages, capture screenshots, and produce structured evidence entries (URL, selector, assertion, screenshot path).
- **aria-refs.mjs** — ARIA accessibility tree element addressing system. Maps semantic roles to stable selectors so browser-evidence assertions survive DOM changes.
- Evidence from browser tests feeds into `evidence-chain.mjs` alongside unit/build/lint results, giving the Sam verdict a full picture of application health.

## PDCA Auto-Scaling

The PDCA engine now auto-scales iteration limits and review depth based on the complexity score (0-15) from `complexity-scorer.mjs`.

| Complexity Range | Profile | Max PDCA Cycles | Review Tier            |
|:----------------:|---------|:---------------:|------------------------|
| 0-4              | Solo    | 2               | Eng only               |
| 5-8              | Duo     | 3               | Eng + Design           |
| 9-12             | Squad   | 5               | Eng + Design + CEO     |
| 13-15            | Full    | 7               | All 4 tiers + CSO      |

`pdca-engine.mjs` accepts `complexityScore` in `startPdca()` and uses it to set cycle bounds and select which reviewers participate. This eliminates over-review of trivial changes and under-review of complex ones.

## Confidence Decay Learning (`scripts/core/project-memory.mjs`)

Project memory entries now carry `confidence` (0-1), `source` (inferred / user-stated), and `lastDecayed` fields.

- **Decay schedule**: Entries decay by 0.1 every 30 days. When confidence drops below 0.3, the entry is flagged for user re-confirmation.
- **User-stated entries never decay**: If the user explicitly set a preference (`source: "user-stated"`), confidence is locked at 1.0.
- **Re-confirmation flow**: Flagged entries surface during the next planning phase. The user can confirm (reset to 1.0), update, or remove them.

This prevents stale assumptions from silently influencing agent behavior over time.

## Security (`scripts/security/prompt-injection-guard.ts`)

A dedicated prompt injection guard provides defense-in-depth against injection attacks:

- **7 regex patterns** detect common injection vectors: role-override attempts (`ignore previous instructions`, `disregard system prompt`, `you are now a different`, `SYSTEM: override`, `forget everything`, `new instructions:`, `do not follow previous`).
- **base64-encoded payload detection**: Detect long base64 strings (80+ chars) that may hide injection commands.
- **Unicode homoglyph attack detection**: Detect Cyrillic/Greek characters mixed with Latin text to bypass keyword filters.
- **HTML/Markdown injection detection**: Detect `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>` tags that could alter agent rendering context.
- **XML trust boundary wrapping**: All external content (tool output, user-provided files, API responses) is wrapped in `<untrusted>` XML tags before being included in agent context. Agents are instructed to treat content within these tags as data, never as instructions.
- **Fail-closed**: If the guard detects a pattern, the request is blocked and logged. No fallback execution occurs.

## Cost Dashboard (session-end hook)

The agent cost dashboard provides automatic cost tracking and summary at session end:

- **session-end hook** aggregates token usage across all agents spawned during the session.
- Per-agent breakdown: model, input tokens, output tokens, estimated cost (USD).
- Session total with comparison to the 7-day rolling average.
- Cost data is persisted in `.aing/telemetry/` for trend analysis via `aing-analytics.mjs`.
- Alerts when a session exceeds 2x the rolling average, helping catch runaway agent loops early.
